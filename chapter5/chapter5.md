Currently, our setup is such that whenever we receive any IPV4 SYN packet on any port, we are equipped to handle it. However, in a realistic server scenario, we want to listen on specific ports, handling SYN packets selectively to establish connections only where desired. In this chapter, we'll refine our approach to closely model the behavior of Rust's standard library's TCP constructs and ensure our server is capable of concurrent connection management.
